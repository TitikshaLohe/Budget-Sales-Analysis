# Budget-Sales-Analysis

### Problem Statement:
* The project focused on obtaining insight for budget sales analysis in the retail and sales domains.
* To make the buying process easy, purchase domains available for sale without the need to contact the seller directly.

### Objective:
* Creating a dashboard using available data with meaningful information.
* Extract various information, such as sales, budget, and variance.
* Extract the necessary information about products and customers.
* Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes.

### Insights:
* From 2014 to 2016, total revenue made by selling bicycles and cycling accessories was 
   45.98 M with a profit margin of 64.5%.
* The year 2016 saw an exponential increase in sales, which was 5.4 M, and sales started trending up in
  2014 rose by 132.94% in 2 years.
* Females accounted for 50.46% of total sales.  
* The top countries making the highest profit are Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the US.
* Across all six countries, the total sales quantity ranged from 8424 to 32307.   
* The United States accounted for 31.97% of total sales.
* The highest profit under the product category is made by bikes, followed by accessories and clothing.

### Recommendations:
* We can target more customers in the USA and Australia as they generate more profit, i.e., 57.79% compared to Germany, France, and Canada. 
* Our focus should be on regions that generate less profit.
* Targeted marketing strategies are recommended for both genders to boost sales.
* A marketing strategy targeting women should be implemented to improve bike sales.
